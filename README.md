# Lounge search

https://lounge-search.herokuapp.com/

LoungSearch is a free lodging website for those who want to explore the various spots of San Francisco, 
with locals who know the area, inspired by CouchSurfing. 
It utilizes React/Redux frameworks on frontend and Rails/PostgresSQL on backend.
The whole project was designed and developed within two weeks.
There are still plenty of new features to be implemented, so I'm planning to continue making improvements in the future.
